# Why I'm an Alchemist
## _Educating and empowering the web3 revolution!_

Hi [@thatguyintech](https://twitter.com/thatguyintech) and Alchemy!
I'm David Brown or [@dgbweb3](https://twitter.com/dgbweb3) and this is why I think I'm ready to join the Alchemy team.

- An educator at heart and currently teaching Blockchain Fundamentals at Portland State University 👨🏻‍🏫 
- Always a student attitude. A never ending desire to learn more 🎒
- I'm special (or so my Mom always told me) ✨

## Previous Docs
I have been working on a set of lessons to help guide complete noobs into Web3 which I have brilliantly named #TeachMeWeb3

## Thoughts on Web3
> The future is now!
I envision the world where people become more aware of how their data is used and why it is so important to protect. Web 3 is a step in the right direction to curtailing all of the wrongs in the consumer driven Web 2 model that drains us of our identities to sell a few knick knacks. Education is the key to empowerment and free sources that Alchemy provides to educate developers are crucial to growing the ecosystem and making it more friendly for users. I want to help be a part of something great that changes the world and Alchemy feels like the platform that will guide everyone to the promised land!
